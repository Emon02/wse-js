    In HTML, JavaScript code is inserted between <script> and </script> tags.

    You can place any number of scripts in an HTML document.
    Scripts can be placed in the <body>, or in the <head> section of an HTML page, or in both.
    
    Placing scripts at the bottom of the <body> element improves the display speed, because script interpretation slows down the display.

    
    External JavaScript
    JavaScript files have the file extension .js.
    To use an external script, put the name of the script file in the src (source) attribute of a <script> tag

    External JavaScript Advantages
    1. It separates HTML and code
    2. It makes HTML and JavaScript easier to read and maintain
    3. Cached JavaScript files can speed up page loads

    To add several script files to one page  - use several script tags:

    External References
    An external script can be referenced in 3 different ways:

    1. With a full URL (a full web address)
    <script src="https://www.w3schools.com/js/myScript.js"></script>

    2. With a file path (like /js/)
    <script src="/js/myScript.js"></script>

    3. Without any path
    <script src="myScript.js"></script>
